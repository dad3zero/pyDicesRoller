# pyDiceRoller

Yet another dice roller program.

pyDiceRoller is a simple dice roller essentially made for teaching basic 
programming in Python.

## Running the app
pyDiceRoller is an interactive app to roll dices. Just launch 
`python -m diceroller`.

Use `q` or `Q` to quit the interactive mode.

## How to roll a dice
When asked for, just provide a string like `1d6`.

The first number is the number of dice you want to roll. The second number 
is the dice face count. So the previous example roll one six sided dice.

You can roll any number of dices.

The allowed values for the sides are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 100.

This first version has no more options.
